# Supermarket Management System

This was a team project developed as part of the CSE141 - Introduction to Computer Programming course during my freshman year. The project simulates a supermarket management system, allowing users to register, log in, view and edit personal information, browse products by category, add products to a shopping cart, and finalize purchases.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can register with a username, password, and personal details. Existing users can log in, view, and edit their information.
- **Product Browsing**: Products are categorized into Beverages, Dairy, Poultry, Laundry, Personal Hygiene, and Hair Care. Users can browse products by category, view product details, and add items to their shopping cart.
- **Order Management**: Users can view their shopping cart, modify quantities of items, and finalize their order with a confirmation step.

## Usage

- **Login/Register**: Start by either logging in with an existing account or registering as a new user.
- **Main Menu**:
  - **View/Edit Information**: Modify your personal information.
  - **View Product Menu**: Browse products by category and add them to your cart.
  - **View/Edit Order**: Review items in your cart, make changes, and finalize your purchase.
- **Confirm Purchase**: Finalize your order and receive a confirmation.

## Project Structure

- **Main Program**: The primary logic for the supermarket system, including user authentication, product management, and order processing.
- **Data Handling**: The program reads from and writes to CSV files (`Data.csv` and `Products.csv`) to maintain user data and product information.
